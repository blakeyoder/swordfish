            <p>We work with you to develop and understand the vision for your gathering. This is where we nail down a theme, a time period, or an area of special interest. If you love the idea of tossing back a few in a dimly lit bar that happens to be secreted behind the mechanic shop -- we can bring the speakeasy to you.</p>

            <p>Once we know what you're going for, we research and develop recipes and compile them into a drink list. After we cut out anything that doesn't shine, we have a complete cocktail menu. We will send you a detailed shopping list of exactly what bottles to buy and where you can get them. The mixers, the ice, the glassware, and the bar -- we've got that covered. All you provide is the alcohol.</p>

After every last drink has been poured, we'll pack up and leave you to get some rest.</p>
